NOTES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somehow re-loading desktop.grid fixes the agrv overwrites

SECURITY:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Use session_id to crash OS.js when id has changed (changed computer, interception etc)
  Also, make sure no more AJAX calls can be made!
* Use a licence key of some sort to verify on server-side to handle response
