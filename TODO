BUGS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Maxmimum call-stack size exceed exceptions does not include trace [JS]
* Somehow re-loading desktop.grid fixes the agrv overwrites

SECURITY:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Use session_id to crash OS.js when id has changed (changed computer, interception etc)
  Also, make sure no more AJAX calls can be made!
* Use a licence key of some sort to verify on server-side to handle response

SUGGESTIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* some sort of an application launcher. just an autocomplete search input somewhere in the header bar would be awesome.
* Actual streaming of applications ?! like VNC
